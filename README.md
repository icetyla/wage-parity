This project uses [COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) data and [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page) data to analyze and forecast changes in spending patterns by categories such as Retail and Recreational, Grocery and Pharmacy, and Transit.

Using the provided data, the goal of the project is to create a recommendation system for the amount of wage that should be allocated into a Home Health Aide(HHA) worker's benefit card. Under the Wage Parity law, HHA employees employed at a Certified Home Health Agency(CHHA), Long-Term Home Healthcare Program(LTHHCP), Managed Care Organization(MCO), or a Licensed Home Care Services Agency(LHCSA) are granted a benefit program that allows them to allocate a portion of their pre-tax wage to a benefit card.
